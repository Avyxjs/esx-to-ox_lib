# esx-to-ox_lib

This is a FiveM ESX Related thing! this will replace paycheck.lua, and other normal esx notifications to ox_lib's notification.

## ðŸ’« Where to add each file?

```paycheck.lua ? es_extended/server/paycheck.lua```

```esx_progressbar ? [core]/esx_progressbar```

```esx_notify ? [core]/esx_notify```

```esx_textui ? [core]/esx_textui ```

```THIS ISNT MY CODE*** I edited ESX's code in these files to fit with Overextended's notify system and also progress bar as well as textui```

```Just { DRAG AND REPLACE } EACH FILE.
